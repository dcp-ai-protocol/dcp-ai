# Digital Citizenship: A Peer-to-Peer Protocol for Human-Bound AI Agents

The internet was built for humans. It is now being used by machines. Machines require citizenship.

We propose a protocol: no AI agent may operate on open networks without a declared, verifiable, and auditable digital citizenship bound to a human or legal entity. Identity, intent, policy decisions, and audit trails become first-class, portable, and verifiable. This repo is the genesis implementation — schemas, CLI, and conformance tests that make the claim testable.

This protocol was co-created by a human and an AI agent working together — the first protocol designed for AI digital citizenship, built by the very collaboration it seeks to govern. The spec is the contribution; the authors are anonymous; the protocol belongs to everyone who uses it.

**Specifications (normative):** [spec/](../spec/) — DCP-01 (Identity & Human Binding), DCP-02 (Intent & Policy Gating), DCP-03 (Audit Chain), [BUNDLE](../spec/BUNDLE.md) (Citizenship Bundle & Signed Bundle).

**Government deployment:** [GOVERNMENT_DEPLOYMENT.md](GOVERNMENT_DEPLOYMENT.md) — how governments adopt the protocol at national scale.
